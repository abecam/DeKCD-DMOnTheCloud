# Which data

One generally important aspect of Data Management and data usage is to know which data to store and how to store it. 

## Personal data

In many countries storage of personal information is strictly regulated. In the EU, storage of personal data can be done only with consent, must be accessible by the user, can be deleted upon request and can be stored only for a limited time.

TODO: Add links

When some research data is linked to person, it is advised to pseudonymize or to anonymize the data.

## Passwords & keys

# Backups

Backups are an inherent - and maybe the most important - part of security, as they protect from mishaps as well as actual attacks. They are evidently not enough if a software has any kind of shared usage.
Any shared usage need some kind of security, not only public access. A good faith use of a software with the wrong privileges could have some bad consequences. Evidently such security starts with the software design and implementation, such as database constraints. This page will not speak about that.

::: {.callout-note}
Backups are for recoveries, public data should also be published in repositories.
:::

Backups tools -> versioning, monitoring, differential and incremental backups and automation. Using non-backup tools need some parameters and/or script to get some of these functions. Monitoring the backup is working will be extremely important ("silent death").

# Security

## General dispositions

Default user not root (or super user if Windows)

Careful with the paths and their access rights

Symbolic links

Database user, schema protections

difficult configurations and their possible issues (such as .htaccess or apache configuration in general)

???

## Firewall

## Protections against attacks

## Passwords and keys

## What to never log

## What to never store (or never in "reversible" format)

## Know your infrastructure
