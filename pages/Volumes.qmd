title: "Volumes"
---

Evidently, an important part of Data Management is the storage of data. From container to orchestrated system, data that need to be persisted is saved in volumes. Volume is a kind of abstract name for various solutions, which might be more adapted to certain cases.

Some more advanced solutions might be easy to use, but hard to set-up and maintain. So their usage often depends on what is supported by the Cloud admin.
