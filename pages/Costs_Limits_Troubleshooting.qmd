# The cost of Kubernetes

High complexity of some setup with less clarity than normal installation (complex Helm chart or operator).


# When an image does not work

One common issue with Docker and Kubernetes, or any other technologies using containers, is that the used images must work. Generally, with popular and well-maintained tools it isn't an issue, but there could still be popular tools where the containerisation is an after-thought, and not always up-to-date, or older tools or less popular without an image or with an obsolete image. Or it could be a specific issue that makes this image breaks on your set-up.

In these cases, fixing the issue might be a high-cost operation, and a bare-metal or virtual-machine installation might help figure out the problem and fix it, or at the very last choice, be used instead.
