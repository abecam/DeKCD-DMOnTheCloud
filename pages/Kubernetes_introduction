## Terminology & main elements

A first glance on Kubernetes can be very confusing. A big part of this confusion is due to a lot of "moving" parts with confusing names.

A full list of terms can be found on the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true).

The maim terms/elements you should know are:

* Node: one worker machine in Kubernetes, like a server. Can be a physical machine or a virtual machine.
* Pod: the smallest object in Kubernetes, that will run one or several containers. The containers can be run by docker or other container engines.
* Label: labels are used for Kubernetes to find the different elements.
* Kubectl: the command line tool to communicate with the Kubernetes control center. With it you can create the object, update them, list them...
* Manifest: the JSON or YAML file that define a Kubernetes object. Objects are all elements of Kubernetes: Deployments, Services, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, ...
*
